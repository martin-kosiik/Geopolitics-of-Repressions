\subsection*{International Relations Controls} \label{subsec:geopol_rel_controls}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{International Relations Controls}
The summary of major changes in international relations of the Soviet Union with states that have significant minorities in the USSR that we use as control variable in our default  difference-in-differences specification (equation \ref{eq:dynamic_did}) are provided in table \ref{tab:geopol_relations}. In particular, we created a separate dummy variable for every combination of state and  phase of geopolitical relations. 
The blank cells indicate that no special dummy variable covers that years (i.e. there was no significant change in relations with the given country in that year).
For example in case of Hungarian ethnicity, we created one dummy variable for the period of war with the USSR (from 1941 to 1944) and another one covering the whole post-1945 period. 
We briefly describe the relevant history below to explain why we choose such classification. 
For more detailed information, consult \citet{weinberg_world_2005} or other general overview of World War II.

In case of Japan, the Soviet Union and Japan engaged in minor border clashes near Mongolia from 1935. However, these skirmishes escalated into large scale conflict in 1938 with Battle of Lake Khasan. The war ended in 1939 with a decisive Soviet victory at Battles of Khalkhin  Gol. This defeat deterred Japan from further conflict with the Soviet Union \citep{haslam_soviet_1992}. The two countries remained in peace until August 1945 when the USSR invaded Manchuria. 

The Soviet Union invaded Finland in November 1939. This conflict ended (which became know as the Winter War) in March 1940. This peace did not last long since Finland joined the German invasion into the USSR in June 1941. Hungary was another country that allied with Germany in war against the Soviet Union. 

Poland was attacked by both Germany and Soviet Union in September 1939. By the end of the month  the Polish army was defeated and the Polish territory was partition between Germany and Soviet Union along the line that was agreed in the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact. 
This changed with German invasion in 1941 when the German army gained the control of the whole Poland. Poland stayed under German occupation for 4 years and most of its territory   was liberated by the Red Army by January 1945. 
%the German invasion  in 194 changed this status quo and 

Some cases are difficult to classify. For instance, China was in embroiled in a civil war from 1927 to 1949. Although the Soviet Union sometimes supported certain Chinese warlords, it is hard to identify some major changes in the relations with the Soviet Union and hence China does not appear on this list. Greece was occupied by Italy and Germany from 1941 to 1944  but the Soviet Union was not directly involved in Greece and thus Greece also do not feature on the list. 

Nonetheless, this table provides only very coarse classification of changes in geopolitical relations  and that is why we perform additional checks such as excluding all ethnic groups with independent states from analysis.
