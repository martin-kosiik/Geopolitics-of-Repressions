%\subsection{German minority in the Soviet Union}
\subsection{German–Soviet relations in the interwar period}
The relations between Weimar Germany and Soviet Union can be characterized as neutral or even cooperative. Both countries were somewhat isolated in the international system dominated by western powers (Great Britain, France, USA) and sought to find allies. The good relations were first established by the Treaty of Rappalo in 1922 in which both countries renounced the territorial and financial claims against the other and agreed to secret military cooperation \citep{gatzke_russo-german_1958} and then reaffirmed by the Treaty of Berlin in 1926. Furthermore, a trade treaty was signed between the two countries in 1925 \citep{morgan_political_1963}.

Hitler was named chancellor on 30 January 1933 and effectively become a dictator on 24 March 1933 by the passing of the Enabling Act. 
The relations with Soviet Union quickly turned hostile for several reasons.  First, Hitler called in \emph{Main Kampf} for Germany to obtain \emph{Lebensraum} (living space) in the east, presumably at the expense of the Soviet Union and he often spoke of Judeo-Bolsheviks. Moreover, Hitler soon after his rise to power banned the German Communist Party and started to persecute its members  \citep{haslam_soviet_1984}. 

The opposition to fascism led to change in policy of the Communist International (Comintern)  with appointment Georgi Dimitrov as  its general secretary in 1934. The Communist parties in democratic countries were now encouraged to form coalitions (Popular Fronts) with social democratic parties to prevent rise of fascism, in contrast to the previous aggressive and uncompromising approach. This policy was affirmed by the Seventh World Congress of the Comintern in 1935 \citep{haslam_comintern_1979}.

The newly formed Popular Front coalitions won elections and entered government in some European countries including France and Spain. In Spain however, the coup of nationalists against the new government in 1936 sparked a civil war. The Soviet Union heavily supported the republican government, while Germany supplied the nationalists which further increased the tensions between the two countries. 

As a response, Japan and Germany signed the Anti-Comintern Pact in 1936 which they committed to  co-operate for defense against communistic disintegration. Moreover, the pact 

Meanwhile in the Soviet Union, many people were persecuted for alleged cooperations with Germany including leading general Mikhail Tukhachevsky. 

The orientation of German foreign policy began to shift in spring of 1939.
Until that point, Hitler tried to court Poland to join the Anti-Comintern Pact against the Soviet Union \citep[chapter 26]{weinberg_hitlers_2010}. 
But Poland repeatedly refused and the German army began planing for the invasion of Poland in April 1939 \citep[p. 621]{kotkin_stalin:_2017}. However, France and Great Britain granted security guarantees to Poland in March 1939. 
Hitler thus tried to negotiate neutrality of the Soviet Union in war to avoid simultaneously facing  Western powers, Poland and the Soviet Union.
Soviet neutrality was potentially beneficial for Stalin too. A long and 
costly war would weaken the both the capitalist and fascist enemies of the 
Soviet Union. Moreover, Stalin believed that conditions of war could bring 
about socialist revolutions in those countries just as in Russia in 1917.  
After brief negotiations, on 23 August 1939   the  Molotov-Ribbentrop pact 
was signed between Germany and the USSR which guaranteed non-belligerence 
between the two countries. In addition,  a secret protocol of the treaty marked the German and Soviet spheres of influence in Eastern Europe.

The pact of the two ideological enemies caused great shock and astonishment both among official and ordinary people. 
%Therefore in case of war, Germany could be facing coalition of Western powers, Poland and the Soviet Union. 


%Nevertheless, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany were able to cooperate inareas of common interest under special circumstances in late 1930s. Inparticular, on 23 August 1939 they sighed the  Molotov-Ribbentrop pact which guaranteed non-belligerence between Germany and the USSR and dividedthe spheres of influence in the Eastern Europe. This of course ended with German invasion into the USSR in June, 1941.  

%Except the brief period of limited cooperation, the Germany represented an ideological and geopolitical opponent. The Soviet propaganda portrayed Nazi
%Germany as an existential enemy and rank-and-file NKVD officers would
%perceive it as such (which is why Molotov-Ribbentrop pact caused such a surprise). \citep{kotkin_stalin:_2017}

The pact was surprising for many people including Party officials. 
Robinson, Black on Red, 137. “It left us all stunned, bewildered, and groggy with disbelief,” recalled one loyal party member (who later defected). 
Victor  \citet[p. 332]{kravchenko_i_1947}, a Soviet official who later defected to the US,   described in  his memoir the disbelief upon hearing about the pact  

\begin{quote}
There must be some mistake, I thought, and everyone around me seemed equally incredulous. After all, hatred of Nazism had been drummed into our minds year after year.    

%The big treason trials [...] have rested on assumption that Nazi Germany and its Axis friends [...]  were preparing to attack us.

\subsection{Political repressions in the Soviet Union}
The Soviet Union had massive coercive apparatus. The Soviet secret police (which was throughout the years named the Cheka, OGPU, NKVD, MVD and  the KGB)\footnote{We will refer to the soviet secret police as the NKVD in this text since this was the name of the agency for the largest part of the period of our interest} employed at its height (1937–1938)  270,730 persons \citep[p. 2]{gregory_terror_2009}. The gulag  
The political repressions were usually carried under article 58 of the Criminal Code. The article 58 punished counter-revolutionary activities 
%defined as "any action aimed at overthrowing, undermining or weakening of the power of workers' and peasants' Soviets... and governments of the USSR". This 
which included treason, espionage, counterrevolutionary propaganda or agitation and  failure to report any of these crimes. Most 
In practice, this broad definition meant that anyone regarded as politically inconvenient could be arrested and prosecuted. 

During the mass camapaings, the central office of the NKVD would typically set quotas for the number of arrests which the regional branches were supposed to reach and exceed \citep[chapter 6]{gregory_terror_2009}. The local NKVD officer had to decide themselves who to target to meet the quotas. 

The sentences were in most cases issued extrajudicially by so-called \enquote{troikas}, three-person committees composed of a regional NKVD cheif, a regional party leader, and a regional prosecutor. The NKVD chief usually dominated the process as party leaders sometimes feared that they themselves would be targeted \citep[p. 82]{snyder_bloodlands:_2011}. Only rarely was a person acquitted from his charge.

The sentences in these case were either execution or term in a labor camp (Gulag) \citep[p. 21]{gregory_terror_2009}.
In some cases the Gulag term could be less than 5 years.

\subsection{Ethnic minorities in the Soviet Union}
The Soviet Union was from its inception a multi-ethnic state. 
According to the 1926 Census, the Russians made up only half of the total population.\footnote{The census data were obtained  Institute of Demography of the National Research University Higher School of Economics} Among other large ethnic group were Ukrainians, Belorussians and Kazakhs.  A significant fraction of citizens of the USSR belonged to ethnic groups with their own independent states including Polish, German, Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Finish,  and Greek minorities. 
The Bolshevik elites were aware of the multi-ethnic nature of their newly formed state and wanted to  avoid a perception of the Soviet Union as a project of Russian imperialism. Furthermore, the Bolsheviks hoped that
they could exert political influence in (this was know as a \enquote{Piedmont Principle})
by promoting the interests of minorities in the USSR

As a consequence, the Soviet policy towards its ethnic minorities In the 1920s was largely accommodating \citep{martin_affirmative_2001}. The languages and culture of minorities were promoted and minorities were encouraged to enter local governments and party structures (so-called \emph{korenizatsiya} policy). In some cases Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics (ASSR) were established (including Volga German ASSR) which had given the regional minorities certain degree of independence. 
%One of the rationale for \emph{korenizatsiya} policy given by Lenin was so-called Piedmont principle. The Bolshevik elite hoped that by promoting the interests of minorities in the USSR, 
%they could project influence in other countries by explointing the cross-border ethnic ties of minorities. 
%the ethnic minorities would use their cross-border ties to start socialist revolutions. 

This attitude changed drastically in the 1930s.
First, the  \emph{korenizatsiya} policy started to be reversed in the 1932.
The main
The Soviet state then gradually  began to target ethnic minorities for repressions  which culminated in the mass national operations of the NKVD of 1937-1938 resulting in more than 100 000 people being killed and many more sent to the Gulags (forced labor camps) \citep{martin_origins_1998, gregory_terror_2009, snyder_bloodlands:_2011}. 
The persecutions  further escalated with the World War II. Following the German invasion into the Soviet Union in 1941, Stalin ordered deportation of about 400 000 Volga Germans into Kazakhstan and Siberia \citep{polian_against_2003}.
