\section*{Abstract}
  I study how geopolitical concerns influence attitudes of a state toward its minorities. I exploit the  Hitler's rise to power in 1933 as an exogenous shock to Soviet-German relations. 
    Using the digitized archival data on 2.7 million individual arrests by the Soviet secret police, I apply difference-in-differences and synthetic control method to estimate how changing geopolitical relations influenced repressions of Germans in the USSR. The estimates of both models imply that that the arrests of Germans relative to other minorities increased by approximately 2\% after 1933.
